  "Link directly to publicly available hook inspiration.",
  "Use title-style capitalization for thread headers and avoid punctuation at the end of those headers.",
  "Prefer newer, higher-quality source videos or source material over older ones.",
  "End each tweet with a banger line (a hard-hitting 'bar' designed for shareability).",
  "Use clean, consistent spacing between sentences and bullets.",
  "Make content highly specific and actionable; remove generic fluff.",
  "Aim for details the reader cannot easily find elsewhere.",
  "Keep voice original and avoid copy that feels generic or AI-templated.",
  "Go deeper on HOW and WHAT to do, not just high-level claims.",
  "Share practical implementation details (for example, how to monetize or create compelling content).",
  "Be specific with numbers and obsessed with details.",
  "When presenting a step, include both what to do and how to do it.",
  "The more specific the better.",
  "Reference strong proven examples and make each tweet in a thread capable of standing alone.",
  "Pack threads with multiple banger tweets.",
  "Do not copy top tweets verbatim; produce original writing.",
  "Tag relevant people/pages in threads naturally when useful (often 4-6 in a thread).",
  "Diversify examples and lists (do not over-index on one demographic).",
  "Include a clear CTA (follow, reply, bookmark, newsletter/link click).",
  "Provide concrete examples/templates wherever possible (for example, agenda samples or pitch deck examples).",
